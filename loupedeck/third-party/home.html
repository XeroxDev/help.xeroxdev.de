<h1>What means “third-party”?</h1>
<p>Third-Party plugins are not developed or maintained by us. This is just to centralize existing plugins for the users, so you have it easier finding them.</p>
<p>Third-Party Developers are also allowed to add changelog pages, error pages, information (FAQ) pages and so on and can help you a bit more.</p>
<h1>I'm a developer and want to add my plugin</h1>
<p>To add your plugin to this domain, you can fork and create the git repository from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/XeroxDev/help.xeroxdev.de">here</a> and then create a PR.</p>
<p>You have to create in the loupedeck/third-party/ folder a new one with your name and in that a folder with the plugin name, then you can start adding your pages.</p>
<p>So the structure should look like this:<strong> /loupedeck/third-party/</strong><i><strong>CREATORNAME</strong></i><strong>/</strong><i><strong>PLUGINNAME</strong></i><strong>/home.md</strong></p>
<p>Example: <strong>/loupedeck/third-party/MrAwesome/Counter/home.md</strong></p>
<h1><mark class="pen-red">Attention!</mark></h1>
<p>Despite careful control of the content, we assume no liability for the content of third-party providers. The operators of the pages and plugins are solely responsible for their content.</p>
