<h1>What kind of error is that?</h1>
<p>This error indicates that the plugin was unable to connect to YouTube Music Desktop.</p>
<h1>How can I fix this problem?</h1>
<p>It depends why this error occurred. These are the possible reasons.</p>
<h2>1. The application is not installed</h2>
<p>If you don't have YouTube Music Desktop installed, please do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see whether your operating system is suitable for this on the GitHub page of <a href="https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop#available-for">YouTube Music Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Also you can download it from their release tab <a href="https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop/releases">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. The application is not started</h2>
<p>If you have it already installed, just start the software.</p>
