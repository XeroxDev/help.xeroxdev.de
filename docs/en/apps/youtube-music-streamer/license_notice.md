All **first-party** clients and widgets, including the "dev-widget" and any auto-generated examples from the app’s "Generate client" feature, are part of the project's **AGPL-3.0** codebase.

- If you **download**, **modify**, or **redistribute** any of these example clients, your changes **must** be released under **AGPL-3.0**.  
- If you use the “Generate widget” feature and then tweak that code, you’re bound by the same AGPL-3.0 requirements.  

Conversely, if you build a **brand-new** widget **from scratch**—and do **not** copy or link to any AGPL-3.0–licensed files, then you may license that widget under **any** terms you choose.
